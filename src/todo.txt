TODO

Christian:
	-Action/Command System
	-Commandline interpreter
	-Enemies
	-Spellcasting AI for enemies
	-Change entities to store their absolute coords instead of their chunk:minor coords--will improve efficiency, since chunk:minor coords are very rarely used and absolute coords are always used.
		-WARNING: when I work on this it will touch many files and potentially introduce many bugs, so I should do this when noone else is working
	-Implement Serializable for each class that will be saved with the world.
	-Make a random unique naming system for creatures so that the player can refer to them by name when using commands
Michael:
	-Keyboard input
	-Mouse click input (return coordinates of the square the player clicks on, and whether left or right click)
	-Path highlighting: When given a Path object, draw the path in red highlighter on screen in the correct place.
		-Relevant Path members:
			-tl: Top left point
			-maze: char[][] containing the path, as well as a bit of other information that isn't relevant to this.
			-PATH: constant referring to the character in maze that indicates what the actual path is
	-Finish HUD
	-Embedded commandline
	-Finish inventory
		-Basic w/o fancy scrolling for now
		-You have the papers outlining it
	-File saving
		-You have the classstream file i/o javadocs Christian sent you, it would be great for you to start implementing this so Christian can implement serializable for each class that needs to be saved w/ the world

Herman:
	-HUD icons
	-Enemy types
		-Actual names
		-Actual desired behavior (describe in a comment in each creature)
		-Actual 16x sprites associated with each enemy
		-Write a flavor text description for each enemy, so that when the player says "examine enemy at x, y" we can give them flavor text and relevant hp/armor/level info (if we want to give them taht info :P)
	-Spells
		-Actual names
		-Actual desired effects (describe in a comment in each spell)
		-Actual numbers (damage, ticks, etc)
		-Implement the interfaces for types
		-Actual 32x sprites for inventory
	-Terrain names, potential effects if necessary (very few)
		-Flavor text for terrain too, though very limited. "This is stone. It is grey. You can walk on it" "This is lava. You shouldn't walk on it unless you have Fire affinity of X or above"
	-Player icon choices (maybe)
	-Write up details about how you want things to work.
Group:
	-Playable "game" with basic mechanics like movement and executing actions by TUESDAY.
	-Flesh out features and niceify things by THURSDAY
	-Last-minute panic stuff by FRIDAY
